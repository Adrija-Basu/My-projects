You design your guessing game based on a series of questions. Each question has a \'93Yes\'94 and a \'93No\'94 answer. You can think of \'93Yes\'94 as the link to left-child node and \'93No\'94 as the link to the right-child node. These links lead to a path when you can make a conclusion at the leaf-node. You can pick any domain subject to create this game. It can be a \'93Movie Guessing Game\'94 as my example or a car guessing or an animal identification game, etc.}
